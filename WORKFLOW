Once:

- gitcheckout.sh
- checkout.sh <module> when needed

Normal workflow:

- gitupdate.sh
  ^ Will reset all branches, clean non-committed files etc.
    Not strictly needed, gitcommit.sh will also git pull --rebase.
- Download attachments, for example via the AttachmentExtractor extension in Thunderbird.
  Consider asking submission as attachments named project.branch.fi.po, for example gnome-sudoku.gnome-3-8.fi.po.
- switch_to_master.sh or switch_to_3.8.sh to switch between branches
- move_po.sh (or from wiki fetch_translations.sh)
- gitcommit.sh
  ^ In each diff, if not fit for commit, just press Enter to the "Commit?" question. Answer "y" to commit.
    Pay attention to possible errors.

Additional scripts:

- Check out possible new files (untracked files):
  varmistelua_gitstatus.sh

- Check if all pushes were successful:
  varmistelua_gitpush.sh
